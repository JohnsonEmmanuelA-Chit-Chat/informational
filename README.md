# The Group Concept
The  elementary opertions of arithmetic consist in combining two numbers a and b in accordance with some well-defined rules so as to produce a unique thrid number c. For instance, if the law of consumption is ordinary multiplication, we should have c=ab.
  When a dn b are given , the number c can be found in each concrete case.
      But we know that multiplication of two or more numbers obeys certain formal laws which hold for all products, irrespective of numerical values, thus:
                                                                ab=ba(commutative law)
                                                              (ab)c=a(bc) (associative law)   
                                                                 1a = a1 = a 
  The last equation serves to introduce one particular number called unity
     The sceond law statesmore explicitly that, if we put ab=s and bc = t, then it is always true that sc=at.
